	Summary
	Compare data loaded from specified file with the ADemo1 data set
	@param strict Force strict numerical equivalence (disable when using integer C3D's which have rounding issues)
	@param forcedecimation If reading from C3D, force will have been supersampled
												and must be decimated by factor 2 to get back to original
  @param checkmarkerid Verify that marker hardware ID's are as expected (disable for C3D's which don't store marker ID)
	@param checksubjectdata Look at subject data fields (Age, Height, Weight, segment properties, etc)
